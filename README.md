# Frontend-Mentor-Showcase

**This website contains all my solutions to the popular coding challenge website <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor
                      </a>. The goal of these challenges is to reproduce the given design of a website as accurately as possible. It helped me shape who I am as a web developer today because I started using this website soon after I picked up web development! I learned how to apply concepts into practice and play around with different approaches. I documented my journey in the GitHub README's in each of my challenges. You can find the link to my Frontend Mentor profile after Contact section.**
